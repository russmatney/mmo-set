## A simple set game... for now

I'm hoping to take this up to MMO status...

To play:

'''bash
cd app/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
'''

Then open up localhost on port 8000.

## Front end to-dos:

- [ ] add number dimension to each card and logic
- [ ] refactor into controller files that make sense
- [ ] unit tests for factories
- [ ] add grunt for server, tests, build, auto-refresh
- [ ] refactor css to use a preprocessor
- [ ] coffeeScript?
- [ ] ...design?

## Back end to-dos:

- [ ] node server and socket.io instance
- [ ] create unique sessions
- [ ] users? not sure how involved this should be
